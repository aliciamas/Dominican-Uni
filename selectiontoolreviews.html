            <p>Goal 4: Synthesize theory and practice within a dynamic, evolving, and diverse information environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outcome 4a. Apply library and information science theories, principles, and research to professional practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Selection Tool Reviews satisfy Outcome 4a as I've applied the knowledge (theories and principles) and tools gained from my reader's advisory course—using trusted book lists from professional sources provided in the course—and incorporated them into this Collection Development course project. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Employing reader's advisory theory and principles I learned through course readings, I gathered reputable sources for book recommendations and reviewed them. I then applied these principles in what would be a professional setting (as this is a fictional scenario), describing the advantages of these selection tools, such as their search capabilities and how they compare to other tools. I also discuss their efficiency in practice, which is crucial in the fast-paced environment of public libraries where I've worked in reader's advisory.
            </p>

                The project's audience is library and information science professionals via a newsletter. It serves as a review and professional resource for book selection recommendations, specifically for adult reference sections in public libraries.
