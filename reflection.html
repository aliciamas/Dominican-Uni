            <p>As I reflect on my e-Portfolio assignment, I am both surprised and proud of the work I have
                created over the years. The process of compiling my work, projects, and assignments into a single,
                organized, digital website collection has provided me with the opportunity to look back on my
                growth throughout the course of the Library and Information Science (LIS) program. It is clear to
                me now how the pieces of my academic journey come together to support the five learning goals
                and their associated outcomes for the program. While the task of compiling this portfolio required
                significant time and effort, it was well worth the investment as it allowed me to see my work
                through a new lens. My e-Portfolio not only showcases my work but also highlights the diverse
                areas of librarianship I have engaged with and the skills I have developed.
