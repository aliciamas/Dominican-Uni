                Outcome 3a. Design resources or tools that facilitate access to information.
            </p>

                The Medical Student Reference Subject Guide satisfies Outcome 3a as it's a resource that facilitates access to information. This subject guide provides an introduction to the website and features reference books, each with a description, summary, evaluation, and location informationâ€”either found in the library or on the library's website.

                Recognizing the abundance of resources available at the medical library, I realized important resources might easily be overlooked. To address this, I focused on core reference titles and created this guide to help students navigate and understand available resources. I also included online databases for quick access, presenting them in the same format as the reference books.
