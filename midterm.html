            </p>
<p>General Main Room Guidelines:

Due to space limitations and health and safety concerns, we can only allow 160 customers in the Main Room at a time.

On Saturdays, tickets will be distributed from 8 to 11 AM. Entry will be granted in the order of your numbered ticket. 

Further, you may take a maximum of 12 books off the shelves at a time.
        </p>
        <p> Shopping Guidelines: After selecting your books, please purchase them and exit through the east door. There you will join the end of the line at the north door to reenter in the order of the remaining tickets.

The 12-book limit will remain in effect past noon if there’s still a line outside.
